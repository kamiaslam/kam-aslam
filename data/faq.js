    question: "What industries do you specialise in?",
    answer: "I have deep expertise in fintech, healthcare, AI, e-commerce, government, and enterprise transformation. My work spans B2B and B2C products across web, mobile, and emerging platforms like conversational AI. Notable clients include HSBC, Barclays, Dell, AWS, EY, and multiple UK government departments."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with startups or only large enterprises?",
    answer: "Both. I've worked with funded startups building their first products and with global enterprises managing complex digital transformations. The principles of user-centred design apply regardless of company size. What matters is the commitment to solving real user problems."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work remotely?",
    answer: "Yes. While I'm based in the UK, I regularly work with distributed teams across Europe, the US, and the Gulf region. I'm experienced with remote collaboration tools and async communication. For discovery phases or critical workshops, I'm also available for on-site work."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your approach to design systems?",
    answer: "I build design systems using atomic design principles - starting with foundational elements (tokens, colours, typography) and building up to complex components. The goal is consistency without rigidity, giving teams the building blocks they need while maintaining flexibility for unique requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle projects under NDA?",
    answer: "Many of my projects involve confidential work. I can discuss my process, approach, and learnings without revealing proprietary details. I also have several case studies from projects where I have permission to share more detail - including Voicecake, Praxia Bank, and Nationwide."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes your approach different?",
    answer: "I combine strategic thinking with hands-on craft. I don't just create pretty screens - I dig into research, facilitate workshops, build systems, and stay close to implementation. I've led teams across multiple continents and understand that great design requires collaboration, not just creativity."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer design leadership or team mentoring?",
    answer: "Yes. Beyond hands-on design work, I offer design leadership consulting - helping organisations build and scale their design capabilities. This includes team structure, hiring, process implementation, and mentorship programs."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your typical engagement model?",
    answer: "I work on both project-based engagements and longer-term retainers depending on the need. For complex products, I typically recommend starting with a discovery phase to properly understand the problem before committing to full design delivery."
